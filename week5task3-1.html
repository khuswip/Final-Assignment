    <p style = "color: purple">Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually</br> 
       refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software </br>
       development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop </br>
       browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has </br>
       become ever-increasingly important.</p>
